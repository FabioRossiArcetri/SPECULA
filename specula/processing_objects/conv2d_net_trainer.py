class Conv2dNetTrainer(BaseProcessingObj):
    """
    Trains a UNetRegressor (specula/lib/efficient_u_net.py) to predict modes
    from 2D maps, on batches buffered by a DataBuffer during the simulation.

    On every trigger, the newest batch is:

    1. read (``input_2d_batch`` -> network input, ``labels`` -> modes to
       predict), with the frames stacked over time (n_frames) and the
       samples taken while the loop wasn't at full gain dropped (optional
       ``gain_mod`` input);
    2. used to set the normalization (from the first batch) or to update the
       output normalization (a slow moving average, see norm_timescale);
    3. split into training samples and validation samples (the most recent
       frames, see val_split); the validation ones join a validation set of
       the most recent val_size;
    4. trained on: epoch_len steps on the whole batch or, with a replay
       buffer (replay_size > 0), minibatches drawn from all the training
       samples collected so far, as many as replay_ratio asks for;
    5. followed by a validation step; every 10 steps the checkpoint is
       saved (see specula/lib/cnn_checkpoint.py), every diag_interval steps
       the diagnostics are printed (specula/lib/nn_training_diagnostics.py).

    The network works on normalized inputs and outputs, but the loss is
    computed in the labels' physical units (e.g. nm): the network output is
    denormalized with meanmodes/stdmodes first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    network_filename : str
        Checkpoint file (``.pth`` is appended if there's no extension); the
        stats are saved next to it as ``<name>_stats.json``.
    nmodes : int
        Number of modes the network predicts.
    load_from_file : bool
        Resume from network_filename if it exists (it must have been
        trained with the same network parameters).

    Network: channels, depth, conv_block_type, head_type, head_grid, dropout
    -- see UNetRegressor (channels = base_channels, dropout = dropout_level).
    They are saved in the checkpoint together with nmodes, input_channels and
    n_frames, and Conv2dNetTester/Conv2dNetRec read them from there.

    input_channels : int
        Channels of the network input, per frame: 2 for the x/y slope maps
        Slopes2D gives for ordinary slopes, 1 for a single map per frame
        (e.g. Slopes2D on slopes-from-intensity slopes, or the per-pixel
        product of a 2-channel buffered value -- see network_input()).
    n_frames : int
        Consecutive frames stacked along the channel axis as the network
        input: sample t gets [x(t), x(t-1), ..., x(t-n_frames+1)], so the
        network sees input_channels * n_frames channels. Over a few frames
        the turbulence is strongly correlated while noise isn't.

    Labels:

    label_offset : int
        Index of the first mode within the buffered 'labels' value (default
        1, for labels whose first entry is a placeholder).
    baseline_offset : int
        Index of the first mode within the buffered optional 'baseline'
        input. When it is connected, the network is trained on the residual
        labels - baseline (residual learning: it only has to learn what the
        baseline reconstructor misses).
    max_label_rms : float
        If set, samples whose labels (modes 0..nmodes-1, in quadrature) are
        larger than this are dropped -- see _label_rms_mask(). In the labels'
        units; pick it from the diagnostics' "labels this window" line.

    Loop transients (optional 'gain_mod' input, the loop gain modulation):

    gain_mod_threshold : float
        Samples with gain_mod below this are dropped: while the loop is
        open or at reduced gain the residual is much larger than in closed
        loop, and not representative of it.
    settle_frames : int
        The first settle_frames frames after the loop is back at full gain
        (gain_mod >= 1) count as its re-convergence transient; the count
        carries over across triggers.
    transient_weight : float
        Loss weight, in [0, 1], of those transient frames (1: same as the
        others; 0: dropped).

    Normalization. The input is normalized by one mean/std over all pixels,
    taken from the first batch and then kept: the network's first block ends
    in a GroupNorm, which rescales every sample itself, so the network is
    insensitive to that choice and nothing is gained by tracking it. The
    output is normalized per mode, and those statistics do matter -- the
    network predicts in that space -- but a few seconds of data don't
    represent an atmosphere that keeps changing. So they follow a slow moving
    average, and every update rescales the network's output layers so that
    its denormalized predictions stay exactly the same: the statistics can
    move at any rate without the network having to chase them.

    norm_timescale : float
        Time constant, in seconds of simulated time, of the output
        statistics' moving average. It should span several independent
        draws of the conditions; getting it somewhat wrong costs little,
        since the loss is in physical units and the predictions are kept
        unchanged by each update.

    Training:

    val_split : float
        Fraction of each batch used for validation: its most recent frames,
        as one contiguous block. Frames a few ms apart are nearly identical,
        so with a random split every validation frame would sit next to
        training frames, and the validation loss would reward memorizing them
        rather than predicting new data. The step line reports the loss and
        the FVU (error variance / label variance) on them; the loss, in
        physical units, follows the conditions of the last few batches, the
        FVU much less, so progress, the best step and early stopping are
        judged by the FVU.
    val_size : int
        Validation samples kept, the most recent ones. It sets how much of
        the run the validation FVU averages over: with the conditions
        changing every few seconds, a window of a few seconds makes it follow
        the conditions rather than the network. It only affects what is
        reported, not the training.
    epoch_len : int
        Full-batch steps per trigger, without a replay buffer.
    replay_size : int
        If > 0, keep up to this many training samples (a ring buffer in CPU
        RAM: replay_size x (input pixels + nmodes) x 4 bytes) and train on
        minibatches drawn from all of them. Each batch covers a fraction of a
        second of one atmospheric condition: trained on alone, the network
        forgets earlier conditions.
    replay_subsample : int
        Only every Nth training frame enters the replay buffer: consecutive
        frames at kHz rates are nearly identical, and a larger N makes the
        buffer span more time for the same memory.
    replay_ratio : float
        Minibatch draws per new sample: every trigger takes
        replay_ratio * (samples it added) / replay_batch minibatch steps,
        drawn from the whole buffer. Once the buffer is full, each sample is
        thus drawn replay_ratio times on average while it stays in it. Tying
        the steps to the new data, rather than fixing them, bounds the passes
        over the buffer: with a fixed number of steps, fewer samples per
        trigger -- a larger replay_subsample, or a batch mostly filtered
        out -- meant many more passes over the same samples, and the buffer
        got memorized.
    replay_batch : int
        Minibatch size.
    loss_delta : float
        Huber loss transition point, in the labels' units: errors above it
        count linearly instead of quadratically, so occasional
        large-residual samples don't dominate the loss.
    norm_loss_weight : float
        Weight of an extra loss term: the squared error per mode normalized
        by that mode's std (stdmodes). In the physical-unit loss a mode counts
        in proportion to its variance, so small modes get little push to be
        learned; this term weighs every mode by its own spread. The reported
        losses don't include it.
    grad_clip_value : float
        Maximum total gradient norm; None or <= 0 disables clipping.
    lr_decay : float
        If set, in (0, 1): the learning rate (initially 1e-3) is multiplied
        by it after every trigger (never below 5e-6). Default None: reduced
        by 0.8 when the validation FVU stops improving for patience // 10
        triggers. Either way the learning rate is saved in the checkpoint and
        a resumed run continues from it, so the annealing spans runs.
    patience : int
        Training stops after this many triggers without improvement of the
        validation loss.

    Diagnostics:

    diag_interval : int
        Every this many steps, print diagnostics meant to locate what limits
        the error, and append them as one JSON line to
        ``<name>_diag.jsonl``. 0 disables them.
    diag_ridge_samples : int
        Most recent training samples used to fit the diagnostics' linear
        (ridge regression) baseline.
